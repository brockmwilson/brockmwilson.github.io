I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the University of Oregon. My research interests are in Labor, Health and Behavioral Economics. More recent research has been on pensions and labor outcomes; selection into motorcycling; and wildfire. 

Outside of academia, you can find me cooking, camping, or writing fiction.
