<p style="font-size: 18px;">
I am an economics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oregon. My research interests are in labor economics, public economics, and econometrics. More recently, my research has focused on pensions and labor outcomes, understanding the impact of affirmative action for disabilities, and the effects of retaliation law on firm dynamics. In general, my research explores the following questions:
</p>

<ul style="font-size: 18px;">
  <li>How can we improve labor markets?</li>
  <li>What drives differences in labor outcomes?</li>
  <li>Where are labor policies most effective?</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
I aim to address these questions using empirical methods, while also employing theoretical models to gain a deeper understanding of real-world phenomena.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
My research interests extend beyond economics and encompass topics such as selection into motorcycling, wildfires, and the impact of political regimes.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
Outside of academia, you can find me enjoying activities such as cooking, camping, traveling, and reading/writing contemporary fiction.
