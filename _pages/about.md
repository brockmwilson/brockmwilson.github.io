I am an economics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oregon. My research interests are in labor economics, public economics and econometrics. More recent research has been on pensions and labor outcomes; understanding the impact of affirmative action for disabilities; and the impact of retaliation law on firm dynamics. More generally, my research interests involve these questions:

<ul style="padding-left:450px">
  <li>How can we improve labor markets?</li>
  <li>What drives differences in labor outcomes?</li>
  <li>Where are labor policies most effective?</li>
</ul>

I aim to answer these questions using empirical methods however I also employ theoretical models to better understand real world phenomena.

Research interests outside of this include: selection into motorcycling, wildfires, and the impact of political regimes. Please feel free to email me at: <a href = "mailto: bwilson@uoregon.edu">bwilson@uoregon.edu</a>

Outside of academia, you can find me cooking, camping, traveling, or reading/writing contemporary fiction.
