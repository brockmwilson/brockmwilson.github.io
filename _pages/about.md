My recent research has been on pensions and labor outcomes; understanding the impact of affirmative action for disabilities; and the impact of retaliation law on firm dynamics. I aim to answer these questions using empirical methods. However I also employ theoretical models to better understand real world phenomena. Research interests outside of this include: selection into motorcycling, wildfires, and the impact of political regimes.

Outside of academia, you can find me cooking, camping, traveling, or reading/writing contemporary fiction.
