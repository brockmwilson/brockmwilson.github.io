I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the University of Oregon. My research interests are in labor, health and behavioral economics. More recent research has been on pensions and labor outcomes; selection into motorcycling; and wildfire. 

More generally, my research interests involve these questions:

  - What drives differences in labor outcomes?

  - What factors into an individual's decision to work?

  - How can we improve labor markets?

I aim to answer these questions using standard empirical methods however some questions require a theoretical approach to understand.

Outside of academia, you can find me cooking, camping, traveling, or writing fiction.
