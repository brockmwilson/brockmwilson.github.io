I am an economics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oregon. My research interests are in labor economics, behavioral economics and econometrics. More recent research has been on pensions and labor outcomes; understanding the impact of affirmative action for disabilities; and the impact of retaliation law on firm dynamics. 

More generally, my research interests involve these questions:

  - How can we improve labor markets?

  - What drives differences in labor outcomes?

  - Where are labor policies effective?

I aim to answer these questions using empirical methods however I also employ theoretical models to better understand real world phenomena.

Research interests outside of this include: selection into motorcycling, wildfires, political regimes.

Outside of academia, you can find me cooking, camping, traveling, or writing fiction.
