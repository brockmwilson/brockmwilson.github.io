<font size="4"> 
I am an economics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oregon. My research interests are in labor economics, behavioral economics and econometrics. More recent research has been on pensions and labor outcomes; understanding the impact of affirmative action for disabilities; and the impact of retaliation law on firm dynamics. 
</font> 

<font size="4"> 
More generally, my research interests involve these questions:
</font> 

  - <font size="4"> How can we improve labor markets? </font> 

  - <font size="4"> What drives differences in labor outcomes? </font> 

  - <font size="4"> Where are labor policies most effective? </font> 

<font size="4">
I aim to answer these questions using empirical methods however I also employ theoretical models to better understand real world phenomena.
</font> 

<font size="4">
Research interests outside of this include: selection into motorcycling, wildfires, and the impact of political regimes.
</font>

Outside of academia, you can find me cooking, camping, traveling, or writing fiction.
