<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;"> 
I exploit a policy change for U.S. federal workers’ pension benefits to estimate the effect of pension generosity on worker retirement, retention and recruitment. The policy increased pensions by 16-25%. I find there is a 30.3% decrease in job quits for permanent workers. However, there is little evidence that pension generosity has an effect on new hires. This suggests salience may play a role in how workers value pensions. Additionally, I find a large heterogeneous labor supply response to pension generosity. Altogether, this shows that pension generosity is effective in retaining workers and may have important implications for workforce planning.

<p style="font-size: 1.25em; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;"> A Second Chance at Financial Inclusion: The Impact of Repayment Plans and Incentives on Delinquent Digital Borrowers (with Alfredo Burlando, Silvia Prina, and Michael Kuhn) </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;"> 
Why do such a high portion of digital loans result in default? We evaluate two interventions designed to stimulate the repayment of delinquent digital loans. In a field experiment with a mobile digital lender, we will offer repayment plans and a notification of conditional eligibility for a future loan to delinquent borrowers.  Using a 2x2 experimental design and administrative data from the lender, we will identify the causal impact of each intervention, on repayment rates, and future credit-seeking and repayment behavior.  Using baseline and endline phone surveys, we will also identify impacts on borrower well-being, beliefs about the value of credit, and overall financial inclusion.
