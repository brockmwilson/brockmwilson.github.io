<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;"> 
I exploit a policy change on U.S. federal workersâ€™ pension benefits to estimate the effect of pension generosity on worker retirement, retention and recruitment. The policy increased pensions by 16%-25% or approximately $111,000. The findings indicate that pension generosity decreases labor supply for the oldest workers, but increases labor supply for low wage workers. Additionally, there is a 30% decrease in job quits for permanent workers. Last, there is little evidence that pension generosity has an effect on new hires. Altogether, this shows that pensions are effective in retaining workers and have important implications for workforce planning.

<p style="font-size: 1.25em; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> Affirmative action for people with disabilities: who gets hired? (with Glen Waddell) </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;"> 
In January 2017, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a final ruling that required federal agencies to engage in affirmative action for people with disabilities. Agencies had to meet a 2\% goal for targeted disabilities and a 10\% goal for non-targeted disabilities within upper and lower payscale categories. Additionally, this ruling mandated agencies provide personal assistance services as part of reasonable accommodation. We explore the heterogeneous ways agencies act to meet quotas, specifically if agencies engage in different hiring practices. Further, we explore heterogeneous disability types to see if hiring changed across types.

<p style="font-size: 1.25em; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> A Second Chance at Financial Inclusion: The Impact of Repayment Plans and Incentives on Delinquent Digital Borrowers (with Alfredo Burlando, Silvia Prina, and Michael Kuhn) </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;"> 
Why do such a high portion of digital loans result in default? We evaluate two interventions designed to stimulate the repayment of delinquent digital loans. In a field experiment with a mobile digital lender, we will offer repayment plans and a notification of conditional eligibility for a future loan to delinquent borrowers.  Using a 2x2 experimental design and administrative data from the lender, we will identify the causal impact of each intervention, on repayment rates, and future credit-seeking and repayment behavior.  Using baseline and endline phone surveys, we will also identify impacts on borrower well-being, beliefs about the value of credit, and overall financial inclusion.
