I exploit a policy change on U.S. federal workers’ pension benefits to provide estimates of the effect of pension generosity on retirement decisions. Using a large administrative data set, I estimate elasticities of -0.1 to 0.1 showing that pension generosity has little effect on an individual’s decision to retire. In the long run, I find that there is no effect of pension generosity on number of retirements or lifetime of labor supply. Further, I find that there is significant effects on retention and firm accessions. There is approximately 30% decrease in job quits and a half year increase in education of new hires. Altogether, this shows that pensions have little impact on retirement decisions, but are an important part of a worker’s compensation.
